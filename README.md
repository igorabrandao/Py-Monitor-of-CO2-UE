### Overview ###

The Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 requires Member States to record information for each new passenger car registered in its territory. Every year, each Member State shall submit to the Commission all the information related to their new registrations. In particular, the following details are required for each new passenger car registered: manufacturer name, type approval number, type, variant, version, make and commercial name, specific emissions of CO2, mass of the vehicle, wheel base, track width, engine capacity, fuel type and fuel mode. Additional information, such as engine power, were also submitted. Data for EU-28 are reported in the main database.

Taking it in consideradion, we used Python, Bokeh charts and Jupyter tool to analyse this mass of data and get insights such as:

- How much CO² each manifacturer emits?
- Which fuel type is more ecologically sustainable?
- The engine capacity implies directly in its pollution emission?

### How to use ###

1. Download the *py-monitor-of-co2-ue.ipynb*, *CO2_passenger_cars_v12.csv* files and put it in the same folder. 
2. After that, use Jupyter notebook tool and access the directory with the files. Enjoy yourself! :)

### Final considerations ###

The experience of work with Python, bokeh charts and Anaconda/Jupyter notebook showed to us lots of possibilities to analyse large amounts of data and consequently have great insights about it. The next step is transform these statics visualizations into dynamic simulations, such as real time dashboards.
